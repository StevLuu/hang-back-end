# hang-back-end
django back end for my game
issues:
front end broke to extent that I had to create a new git repo and move it over (hence the front-end repo name)
when moving the files over they got deleted and I had to redo my front-end
back end deployment didnt work and had to spend a lot of time figuring it out.
Was traveling and didnt have stable connection to look things up and such.
